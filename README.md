# Adobo Twobe

# 🎉 Welcome to TwoBe by Adobo - Your 3D Model Mastery Tool! 🎉

# Why I Made TwoBe

I took the foundations originally hardcoded by Grok and tweaked them into something special because I believe 3D model viewing shouldn’t be a luxury or a hassle! 🔧 Frustrated by expensive licenses and bloated interfaces, I created TwoBe to deliver a free, intuitive platform for opening, exploring, and capturing 3D models with ease. 📐 This is my passion project to empower creators everywhere! 🙌

# Why I’m Against Proprietary 3D Tools

Corporate 3D software—like certain overpriced suites—locks users into subscriptions, restricts access, and stifles innovation! 🔐 I’m done with greedy practices that gatekeep creativity and technical exploration. 🌍 TwoBe is my rebellion against these barriers, offering a no-strings-attached solution that puts the power back in your hands! 💥
